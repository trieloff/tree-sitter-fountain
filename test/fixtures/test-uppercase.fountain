EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A BRICK falls from the building.

The PORSCHE speeds by, narrowly missing the BRICK.

Inside the car, we see a KEY PROP on the dashboard.

The driver notices the DANGER and swerves to avoid the BRICK AND STEEL falling from above.

DRIVER
That was close!

He checks the VITAL DOCUMENT in the glove compartment.
