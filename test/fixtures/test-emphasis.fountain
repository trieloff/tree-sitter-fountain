INT. OFFICE - DAY

The document contains *italics*, **bold**, and ***bold italics***.

There is also _underline_ formatting available.

From what seems like only INCHES AWAY. _Steel's face FILLS the *Leupold Mark 4* scope_.

Mixed emphasis: **This is bold with *nested italics* inside**.

Edge case with spaces: * not italic * and _ not underline _.
