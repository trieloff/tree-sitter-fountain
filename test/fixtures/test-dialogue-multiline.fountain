EXT. PARK BENCH - AFTERNOON

ELDERLY MAN
When I was young, things were different.
We didn't have all these gadgets.
We talked to each other, face to face.

YOUNG WOMAN
(listening intently)
Tell me more about that time.

ELDERLY MAN
Well, for starters...
We used to write letters.
Real letters, with pen and paper.
Can you imagine that?

YOUNG WOMAN
That sounds lovely.
